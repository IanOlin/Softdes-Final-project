#Feedback and decisions
##Feedback
- Don't spend too much time on trying to get the audio out
- Use circles as a visualizer
- Show the notes of the music playing
- Based on speed, possibly reduce the amount of data that we process

##Decisions
- 

#Review process reflection
> How did the review go?
- The review went well
> Did we get answers to our key questions?
- We got answers to most of our key questions. We got excellent feedback on ideas for visualizers and for other algorithms that we could include in our project. We did not get much feedback in terms of what FFT we should implement
> Did we provide too much/little context to our audience?
- Overall, we provided the right amount of context to our audience. We did not provide enough information for the audience to give feedback about different FFTs
> Did we stick closely to our planned agenda?
- We went in the order of our planned agenda
> What could we do next time to have an even more effective technical review?
- We could provide more information on the more technical ideas that we are going to talk about such as FFTs
