# Preparation and Framing Document II
## Background and Context:
### Fast Fourier Transforms
FFT is a method to transform signals in the time domain to signals in the frequency domain. This means that when you have an audio signal in the time domain (which is what you hear) you can sample that and transform that into a representation of what frequencies are in the music. 
### What we had last time
Last time we had not completed a fourier transform. Now we have a fourier transform running in Python; however, we are having some issues displaying the upper range of the frequencies. We'd love suggestions on how to fix this.
### What we have now
We can display the time domain signal now. We can display the frequency domain up to 1400hz. Carl has implemented a text representation of the time domain in C++. We are likely going to transition into using more C++.
## Key Questions
- What can we do to display the full range of frequencies?
- Is it okay to switch languages?
