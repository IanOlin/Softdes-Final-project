## Agenda
- present agenda
- present background
- get design feedback on idea
- ask questions
- get techincal feedback

## Background
- We want to build a program that generates spectrograms in real time
- This requires the Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) -which we will build an implementation of ourselves
- Finally we will display the audio out of the computer in the time domain and frequency domain

## Questions
- How to reliably get system-out audio from a computer?
- ALSA :(
- Which implementation of FFT is actually fast?
- Is python actually fast enough?
