# SPECTROGRAM TEAM 2
We plan to implement the FFT by hand along with a couple of other music analysis libraries, as well as build it to handle real time analysis based on system out sounds.

##Dependencies
```
$ sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy
```

To run the shell script that sets up pulseaudio run following commands:
```
$ cd Softdes-Final-Project
$ chmod +x ~/Softdes-Final-Project/install.sh
$ ./install.sh
```

##Running the program
```
$ python2 pulse.py
```
