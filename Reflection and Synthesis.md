## Reflection and Synthesis
1. Feedback and Decisions
The feedback we recieve was very helpful and showed us some useful areas our project could explore later down the line, but didn't adress our technical questions. We were looking at pretty area specific processes with our technical questions so we didn't get useful feedback for them, but Duncan and Becca's design help was very useful. Duncan suggested showing particular frequencies that were notes in greater detail because that would be of particular interest to musicians. Becca suggested doing the visualization with different sized dots based on intensity, allowing us to capture both frequency and time in one graph.
2. Review Process Reflection
Overall I thought the review went well. Carl and I could have made more progress which would have allowed us to give better context. Our context seemed to be sufficient for people to understand the project, but they couldn't help give us direction because they couldn't see what we were doing. We ended up sticking pretty close to our planned agenda. We didn't find any areas came up that we hadn't anticipated in preparing for the presentation. Next time I would have liked to prepare videos of our project working to show what it is like the group doing evolution was. I thought that gave me a really good idea of what their project was, plus it was very interesting.
